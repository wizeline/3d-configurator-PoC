# 3d-configurator-PoC
The main objective of this experience is to allow users to navigate a realistic 3D scan of a location and interactively place configurable 3D assets within the environment. This enables simulation and visualization of asset placement in real-world spaces, providing an immersive and practical tool for design, planning, and sales.
